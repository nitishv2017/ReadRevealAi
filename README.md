## 💭 Developer's Comment

> I'm building ReadReveal AI as part of a new wave of serverless applications that put users in control. By using your own API keys directly with LLMs like Google's Gemini, we can:
> 
> - **Eliminate expensive backend costs** that would otherwise be passed to users as subscription fees
> - **Increase privacy** by keeping your data flowing directly between your device and the AI provider
> - **Provide powerful AI tools as free, open-source software** accessible to everyone
> - **Build sustainable products** that don't require ongoing server maintenance
>
> This "bring-your-own-API-key" approach enables developers like me to create useful tools without the traditional SaaS cost structure, helping democratize access to cutting-edge AI capabilities.
