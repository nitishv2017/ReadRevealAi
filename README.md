## 💭 Developer's Comment - Bring Your Own API key

> I'm building ReadReveal AI as part of a new wave of serverless applications that put users in control. By using your own API keys directly with LLMs like Google's Gemini, we can:
> 
> - **Eliminate expensive backend costs** that would otherwise be passed to users as subscription fees
> - **Increase privacy** by keeping your data flowing directly between your device and the AI provider
> - **Provide powerful AI tools as free, open-source software** accessible to everyone
> - **Build sustainable products** that don't require ongoing server maintenance
